# 🧠 AI Mental Health Assistant
 
A conversational **AI-powered mental health companion** built using **OpenAI**, **AutoGen**, and **Gradio**.
This assistant engages in a **multi-agent dialogue** to:
 
1. Understand how a user feels (Patient Agent)
2. Analyze emotional tone (Emotion Analysis Agent)
3. Provide personalized self-care and relaxation suggestions (Therapy Recommendation Agent)
 
> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is **not a replacement for professional mental health care**. It is a demo for educational and experimental use only.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
 
### 1. Clone the Repository
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agoelgit/MentalHealthAutoGen
cd ai-mental-health-assistant
```
 
### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
 
```bash

source venv/bin/activate     # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # On Windows
```
 
### 3. Install Dependencies
 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
 
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
 
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
MODEL_ID=gpt-4o-mini
PORT=7860
```
 
You can use `MODEL_ID=gpt-4o-mini` or another supported model.

## 🧠 How It Works
 
### 🤝 Multi-Agent Flow
 
1. **Patient Agent** — Accepts the user’s emotional description.
2. **Emotion Analysis Agent** — Analyzes text to detect emotional states (e.g., sadness, anxiety, joy).
3. **Therapy Recommendation Agent** — Suggests coping mechanisms and self-care activities based on the analysis.
 
All interactions are coordinated by the **GroupChatManager**, which facilitates a round-robin dialogue between the agents to produce the final output.
